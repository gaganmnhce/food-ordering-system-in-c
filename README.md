The first component of a food ordering system is the login or sign up, where the customer can sign up 
providing all the necessary information or they can login provided that they are already a previous user 
of the system. The staff of the restaurant can login through the admin credentials.

The second component of a food ordering system is the menu, in which the restaurant will be able 
upload its menu and update it as needed. This system ensures that customers have access to the most 
up-to-date information about the restaurant's offerings. Even if there is any special occasion the 
restaurant can change the menu as swiftly as possible. The customers can access the menu and order 
what and how much they need.

The third part is the bill of the order that the customers ordered to eat. The customers will be able to 
get the summarized bill and they can cross verify and later they can move on with the payment.
